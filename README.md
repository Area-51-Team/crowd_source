## Overview
### Description
In this project, you will design and implement a crowd-sourced voting/rating app for anyone.
Using the app, users can rate anything from food and coffee, to classes and labs. Also users are
able to see the ratings of the item of their interest, which is provided by their peers. Using this
crowd-sourced rating app, anyone with a valid email can post reviews/ratings on all sorts of
entities - courses, professors, labs, events, food, cafes, concerts, etc. The system should provide
guaranteed anonymity for the users.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.

## Product Spec
### 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)

**Required Must-have Stories**

[] User should be able to register and rate/review entities anonymously.
[] User should be able to search for entities in meaningful ways both for lookup and to rate.
[] Matches have a chat window to get to know each other, with the ability to skip music and unmatch (Tinder Style).
[] Profile pages for each user
[] Settings (Accesibility, Notification, General, etc.)
[] There are two different types of ratings and questions:
1) Polling questions: User can set up a polling question that may have any number
of options.
For example: Which Cafe is best on campus?
a.
Sturbucks
On Fourth - A Novel CafÃ©
C.
Philz Coffee
2) Rating questions: User set up a rating question with different point scales.

**Optional Nice-to-have Stories**

* If the number of useful votes for a rating question exceeds a threshold (e.g. 50
positive votes), the rating question stays open forever and will remain in the
system. Result for such rating questions would be visible to everyone always.
